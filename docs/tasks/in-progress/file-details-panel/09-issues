## New Issues Found (February 1, 2026)

### 1. Impact Graph "File not found" Error
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Location:** `/repos/{id}/graph?path=...`

**Symptom:** When a valid file path is in the URL (e.g., `pyproject.toml`), the UI shows "File not found. Pick a file from the tree or a preset." but the graph data still loads and renders.

**Root Cause:** The `getLineage()` API call was failing (returning 404 for files without lineage data), which caused the entire `loadData` try block to fail, showing the error message even when the primary data loaded successfully.

**Fix Applied:** Made lineage data optional in `ImpactGraph.tsx` - wrapped `getLineage()` in its own try-catch so it doesn't fail the entire data load if lineage is unavailable.

### 2. Empty Lineage Data (Not a Bug)
**Severity:** Low  
**Status:** ⚠️ By Design  
**Location:** Impact Graph → Lineage section

**Symptom:** Lineage section shows no data.

**Analysis:** 
- The `/files/{path}/lineage` API endpoint exists and works correctly (returns 200)
- The `file_lineage` table in the database is empty because the extraction doesn't currently track file renames
- This is expected behavior - the endpoint returns an empty array `[]`

**Resolution:** 
- The lineage feature requires enhance extraction to track file renames via `git log --follow`
- Not blocking for this feature epic

## Remaining Issues (Moved to global-issues.md)

| Issue | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| URL should contain file path | ❌ Open | Architectural change needed |
| Commits shows less than GitHub | ❌ Open | Extraction may have date filters |
| Additions/Deletions always 0 | ⚠️ By Design | Extract uses `--name-status` not `--numstat` |
| Coupling always 0 | ✅ Not a bug | Some files genuinely have 0 coupling |
| Churn Rate 0 | ⚠️ Partial | Depends on commit date range |

## Non-Feature Issues (See global-issues.md)

These issues require changes outside the File Details Panel feature scope:

1. **Low Commit Counts** — Analysis date filters, re-extract needed
2. **Missing Line Stats** — Extract enhancement needed  
3. **URL State Persistence** — Router architecture change needed
4. **Lineage Data Empty** — Extract enhancement for rename tracking needed
