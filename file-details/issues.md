hot / stable filters seems not work
view should be compact by defautl with icon button to exapnd all / collapse all
need button to open (next to copy path) to open in git repo like github and azure deveops 
somes files has 0 commits how this is possible ex http://localhost:5173/repos/openhands/file-details/.devcontainer%2FREADME.md
.devcontainer/README.md
Need to add back icons lke hot ... see from /home/afettah/workspace/git-coupling-analyzer/LOST_FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md what can add back also as features
need a sort fueature sort by name, commits ....

can we add mouse range selector in timeline-chart  to select a range of date to zoom in
we have horizental scrooml that is not expected ; and sroll somthing stucks and conflict with the main page vs the section one
top section should not be pined we shoudl have page scrollable nativly
move tabs in top of the page with information as tab as others 
the side left bar should be collapsble

lines Changed seem not display anithig why 

we should provide details on click or on second mouse click to open detaisl or go to source, commits ... all information provided should allow to navigate to another url if possible in the app or to the source
design a relible ux for this to provide and enrich all the avialible information
